            <h2>üöÄ Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In today's fast-paced tech world, staying updated with tools and trends is crucial. One tool that stood out in Phase 1 is <strong>JSON Server</strong> ‚Äî a simple way to simulate a REST API with zero back-end code!
            </p>
            <p>
                As web development evolves, developers need efficient ways to prototype and test their applications. JSON Server provides a quick solution for creating a working backend without writing complex server logic.

            <h2>üìà Key Industry Trends</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Increased use of mock APIs for frontend development
                    <br>
                    <small>
                        Mock APIs allow developers to build and test user interfaces independently from the backend. This speeds up development and helps teams work in parallel.
                    </small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Growth in JAMstack and headless CMS platforms
                    <br>
                    <small>
                        JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) and headless CMSs separate the frontend from the backend, making sites faster, more secure, and easier to scale.
                    </small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Demand for JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue
                    <br>
                    <small>
                        Modern frameworks such as React and Vue simplify building interactive user interfaces and are widely adopted in the industry.
                    </small>

            <h2>üõ†Ô∏è What is JSON Server?</h2>
            <p>
                JSON Server lets developers build a full fake REST API with minimal setup. This is especially useful for beginners to practice <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> requests.
            </p>
            <p>
                With just a simple JSON file, you can create endpoints that behave like a real server. This means you can test your frontend code, simulate data changes, and even collaborate with others before the actual backend is ready.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, you can create a <code>db.json</code> file with sample data, run JSON Server, and instantly have a working API at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.
            </p>

            <h2>‚úÖ Best Practices Learned</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Use version control with Git
                    <br>
                    <small>
                        Version control helps track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous states if something goes wrong. It's an essential skill for all developers.
                    </small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write modular and readable JavaScript
                    <br>
                    <small>
                        Breaking code into small, reusable functions makes it easier to maintain and debug. Clear naming and structure also help others understand your code.
                    </small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test APIs before integrating them with frontend
                    <br>
                    <small>
                        Testing APIs ensures that your frontend communicates correctly with the backend. Tools like Postman or browser fetch requests can help verify endpoints and data formats.
                    </small>
                </li>
            </ol>
